# Personal Finance Tracker Application

pi2018@nyu.edu

### What and why?

Personal Finance Tracker (which will need a more catchy name in the future) is an application aimed to help users face one of the biggest financial challenges now days, the lack of awareness about their spending habits. The primary purpose of the application is to help users to take control of their finances by providing insights into their spending patterns, offering personalized recommendations to help them make better financial decisions, and helping users stick to their pre-set budgetary goals. 

### For whom?

Anyone interested in keeping track of their finances or finding ways to save and improve their financial health from college students to professionals. 

### How?

1. Users will be able to create wallets and bugets according to which they want to stick to.
2. Users will be able to enter in their every day expenses and reciepts as well as recurring transactions.
3. Users will be able to see a graphical presentations and analysis on what categories they are spending money on and how much. Categories will be broken down into necessities vs wants and into for example Groceries, Pharmacy, Shopping, Transport, etc. 
5. Users will get notifications when their bugets are running low.

7. (extra) Users will have access to personalized chat bot that can recommend them how to save money, which categories they are spending too much on, and what alternative products they could be purchasing for lower price. 

### Scope

I belive that the project has appropriate amount of work for a group of 4 - 6 students to be done in 1 semester. 
The main parts of the application will be building the database to store the information on each of the users, building the user friendly interface that will motivate users to put in their spendings regularly as well as well full analysis and the presentation of the spendings. I belive that the semseter should be enough to create the previously mentioned functionality as well as adding the personalized chat bot to advisse users on how to spend smarter.
